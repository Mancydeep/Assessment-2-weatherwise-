# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I used Gemini AI as my primary AI assistant throughout this project. Gemini AI helped me solve complex issues related to pulling live weather data from APIs, in-depth understanding of JSON parsing, data visualization techniques with matplotlib, and working around interactive constraints in notebooks. The tool’s ability to provide concise, focused code snippets and troubleshooting advice significantly improved my development efficiency and deepened my technical knowledge.

## Prompting Techniques
My intentional prompting approach involved breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-questions. For example, I asked separately about API usage, specific data extraction, and visualization customization. I also iteratively refined my queries to gather best practices, debug errors, and adapt code for specific notebook environments. Using clear, stepwise prompts helped me receive precise and actionable answers from the AI.

## What Worked Well?
I am most proud of achieving a fully functional, multi-faceted weather dashboard capable of displaying temperature, precipitation, and humidity data visually. The integration of recursive menus that persistently accept user input in a notebook, despite interface limitations, was a key success. The detailed visualizations using matplotlib with annotations and customized styles enhanced usability and presentation.

## What Would You Do Differently?
With more time, I would focus on migrating from CLI menus to an interactive GUI using ipywidgets to improve user experience in notebook environments. I would also expand API integration to support longer forecasts and real-time updates, improving the app's practicality. Further automation in data cleaning and error handling would enhance robustness.

## Final Thoughts
This project offered valuable hands-on experience combining data engineering, visualization, and interactive application design. Using AI tools like Gemini AI was fundamental in accelerating problem-solving and learning technical concepts efficiently. I now feel more confident in developing practical data-driven Python applications and leveraging modern AI assistance effectively.
