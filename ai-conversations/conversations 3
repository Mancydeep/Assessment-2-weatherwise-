Comparing graphical styles for precipitation

Me: What unique styles can I use to display rainfall data for three days?
AI: Try a colored bar chart with gradient shading for each bar using plt.cm.Blues for colors, annotate each with the value, and consider bar width for visual effect.

Me: Is a dot plot appropriate for precipitation?
AI: It's okay for small datasets, but bars are better for daily totals. To further enhance, add value labels above each bar using plt.text.

The conversation aimed to make precipitation visuals more informative and visually distinct from standard bar or line charts in Python.
