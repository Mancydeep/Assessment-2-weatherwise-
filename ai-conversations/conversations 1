Exploring weather data source options

Me: What are the pros and cons of using wttr.in versus OpenWeatherMap for my Weather Advisor assignment?
AI: wttr.in is free, simple, and does not require an API key, but only provides 3 days of forecast. OpenWeatherMap offers more detailed and longer forecasts, but requires registration and an API key.

Me: Which is easier for a beginner to implement in Python?
AI: wttr.in is easier for beginners because you can fetch data with a simple requests.get() call and parse the JSON. OpenWeatherMap requires more setup and handling of API keys.

Me: What are the limitations of wttr.in for my assignment?
AI: The main limitation is the 3-day forecast cap. If your assignment requires more days or advanced features, OpenWeatherMap is better.

The main objective involved testing two weather APIs (wttr.in and OpenWeatherMap) to determine which one would work best for a student assignment. This compared features, ease of use, and constraints for assignment requirements.
