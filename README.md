# 🌦️ WeatherWise — Python Weather Advisor

## 📘 Overview

**WeatherWise** is a Python application that delivers current weather updates by leveraging the **wttr.in API**.  
Users can view daily weather forecasts, ask natural language weather questions, and analyze weather data with interactive charts.  
This project serves as an academic demonstration of modular coding, API usage, and AI-enhanced software development.
